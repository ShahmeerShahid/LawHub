## Release Goals

### Sprint 1

By the end of this sprint, the team would like to have a deliverable with registration and login functionality. The team will also have learned react and the necessary information related to the architecture.

### Sprint 2

Create a deliverable in which quiz creation for recruiters and quiz completion for students is available. Users will also be able to customize their profile.

### Sprint 3

Add filtering functionality for both recruiters and students (students can filter quiz searches and recruiters can filter their candidates based on things like location and law specialty). Recruiters should also be able to see student results on their quizzes, and students can see other student profiles and quiz history. Additionally, there should be a leaderboard for the quizzes so that students can see where they stand compared to others.

### Sprint 4

Students will be able to see featured quizzes recommended to them which includes new quiz postings and quizzes from high profile employers. Students will also be able to receive recommendations on companies based on their preference to make finding jobs easier. Similarly, recruiters will receive suggestions on possible candidates for their positions based on their preferences. Students and recruiters will also be able to freely direct message others.

## Scope of the project
The purpose of this project is to create a platform that bridges the gap between law students and law firms and schools. It will accomplish this by taking the best of both networking platforms (like LinkedIn) and law quiz websites to connect candidates and potential employers with the added feature of candidates completing employer assessments. We want to do this in order to give another highly competitive field the ability to narrow down their job search/recruitment process based on criteria they desire.

Students using this platform will be able to complete assessments and quizzes that will build their portfolio. Recruiters from law schools and law firms will be able to find students based on their portfolios and results, as well as some criteria the recruiters may have. Recruiters will also be able to construct their own assessments composed of their own custom questions and/or questions already available on the platform.

Due to the nature of this project needing to be completed by the end of the semester, our largest constraint is time. To add to this, having other courses to put work into as well makes proper time management is crucial to the success of the project.

To complete this project and create a minimal viable product, we need to find a database or list of questions pertaining to law. We would search for sample and past bar exam questions.
