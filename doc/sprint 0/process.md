*How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?*

To begin organizing the team, we assessed each other’s strengths. We kept track of our team’s individual skills to get an idea of who is capable of completing future tasks at the highest efficacy. For example, Lazar will be focused on developing the data layer (databases), Alfonso and Michelle will be developing the presentation (front end), and Shahmeer and Ahmad will be developing the application layer (back end). We also organized meeting times and places by comparing our schedules and finding times that worked the best. We did not use any tools to complete our organization aside from a group chat to share our schedules and jot down our hard skills.

*How did you make decisions?*

We made decisions such as arrangement times and contact protocols by coming to a consensus among the whole group. However, it is not realistic for everybody to be in agreement all the time. We decided that when it comes to design/implementation decisions, that we would resort to having disputes decided by the majority of a vote. Since there are 5 of us, we will always have a majority after conducting a vote.

*How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?*

We used a 5 point scale with 5 being the highest priority to define priority for each of our user stories. We then used a powers of 2 up to 128 to define the point estimate for each user story. On average, we had one round of voting for each user story as we did not result in a tie often. 

*Did you meet in person or online?*

The entirety of the group met in person.

*How frequently did you meet?*

We met once a week on Monday at 3pm for approximately 1-2 hours, and Thursday at 3pm which is shortly after our tutorial, to discuss what we covered in tutorial.  We also used our group chat to discuss smaller ideas/issues.

*What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?*

Lessons we will take going forward include not hesitating to express our point of view but always respecting our voting protocol. We must all understand not everything will be done how we personally prefer it but this is a part of working in a team. We will always keep this in mind whenever we need to make decisions to remember that our voices will always be heard, however not everything will go our way. This in turn will help keep any conflict to a minimum.

We will also make an effort to begin working early. This will allow us to have time for questions and debates on implementation and design decisions. We will also have much more time to deal with roadblocks and will not need to rush any features due to an approaching deadline.
