#__Competitor #1: LinkedIn__
(https://ca.linkedin.com/)

Our platform is different from LinkedIn since our product has the goal of being a networking platform for a specific group of individuals, that being law students at different stages in their career and potential employers. As such, our platform is better for law students looking to prepare for law school or join a firm, and advertise their talents by being given credit for completing assessments. From the employer’s point of view, it allows them to view more about an applicant than their paperwork and experience: they can filter candidates by things such as location, school of graduation, quiz scores, and more. This competitor didn’t focus on these aspects since their objective was to create a more general-scope way for employers and applicants to connect.

(https://barprephero.com/ and https://lsat.magoosh.com/)

Our platform differs from these preparation services since we extend them by allowing individuals to display their results on these tests, and provide a method for potential employers to see these results. Further, companies aren’t limited to seeing applicant results from tests created by others; they can create their own assessments for anyone to complete or send specific ones to applicants privately. As explained above, this platform is better for law students at different stages looking to advertise themselves on a specific network of people, and for employers to simplify and personalize their recruitment process. The competition did not focus on this since the purpose of their platforms was specifically to help individuals prepare for these tests.
