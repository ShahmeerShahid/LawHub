#### __Project Outline:__

A platform that connects law students and recent graduates with (articling opportunities/positions) law firms/Universities that are looking for the top performers in their specific specialty of the law. Current law students and new grads can use the platform to showcase their performance by answering quizzes and mock exams, and creating a profile for potential employers/Universities to see. Law firms and Universities can see top performers by geographic area, specialty of law, and university of graduation.

#### __Key Users__

*Recruiters:* The law industry is hyper-competitive — there are thousands of applicants for law school and law firms that have top LSAT scores, excellent extracurriculars, and good experience. Organizations such as top law schools and law firms that receive an overwhelming amount of applications would like some way to quickly and easily filter out applicants. This platform would allow recruiters to narrow down their candidate pool by using certain criteria based on what they’re looking for (location, score on the platform’s quizzes, experience, etc.). Employers can also create their own quizzes/assessments for candidates to complete and have settings to decide the privacy settings of their quizzes.

*Undergraduate Student Looking to Enrol in Law School:* these students are looking to get ahead and find every advantage they can get over their competitor applicants. They can include their lawhub profile in their application to show where they stand among competition.

*Recent/Soon-to-be Law School Graduate:* these individuals are able to put their lawhub profile on their resume for law firm applications to show companies how they have performed in quizzes based on specialty.

#### __Scenarios__

You are a law student that just completed the bar examination. You are now looking to secure a full time position at a firm and you’re not too sure where to start. You head over to our platform to continue to sharpen your law knowledge and show employers what you know. You complete your profile by adding your contact information, resume, and portfolio that employers may view when they search for potential candidates. You also increase your chances by completing applications and screening quizzes for employers that will get in touch with you if they like what they see.

You are the hiring manager for a law firm, and you need an easy way to filter through candidates. You may search for candidates based on location, the school they graduated from, and their speciality. You may perhaps be looking for a way to filter applicants based on their performance, so you set up a quiz on our app that applicants may complete. You have the option to have us grade it (depending on the format of the quiz) or grade it yourselves. Once filtering through applicants, you will be given direct access to their contact information to discuss their qualifications further.

#### __Principles__

The team will follow SCRUM principles during the software development process. Other principles for effective teamwork include: strong communication amongst members, effective approach to conflict management, and mutual respect amongst team members.
