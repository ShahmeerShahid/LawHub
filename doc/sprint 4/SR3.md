We don’t have any unfinished tasks from this sprint.

Practices that we should continue with during the next sprints are: good communication, frequent meetings, and productive coding sessions. 

Some new practices that we want to use for the next sprints are: doing a better job of estimating how long a task will take and planning our time to include debugging and testing.

We did not have any harmful practices during this sprint. Hopefully we won’t have any in the coming sprints either.

Our best experiences from this sprint was the efficient teamwork and good learning experience. All members effectively communicated issues and concerns which were resolved and answered hastily. Each member learned something new about the respective technologies they had to employ for this sprint. Overall, this sprint bettered our experience in terms of working in a team.
On the other hand, one of our worst experiences was having to deal with our course load. 80% of the team members had a very large project in another course which was due halfway through the sprint. Because of this large assignment, most team members had to delay the start time of their tasks. This caused some trouble when it came to testing because it minimized the amount of time we had to test at the end of the sprint. We overcame this challenge in the end, but it wasn’t a fun experience.
