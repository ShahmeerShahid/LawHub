We don’t have any unfinished tasks from this sprint.

Practices that we should continue with during the rest of our project: good communication, frequent meetings, and productive coding sessions.  

This was the last sprint. We improved our practices after every sprint and learned from mistakes. We have all become better programmers and team members. We have all gained valuable experience from this project and through the use of scrum.

We did not have any harmful practices during this sprint. Hopefully we won’t have any in projects we are a part of in the future.

Our best experience from this sprint was the working from home aspect. Because of the COVID-19 situation, we were forced to work from home and have meetings online. All team members did a great job of adapting and working as efficiently as before. Working from home added convenience as we could have a meeting almost at any time and did not have to worry about location.
On the other hand, one of our worst experiences was having to test, combine, and integrate code from subtasks and user stories all from home. We had to communicate through online voice calls and had to alternate sharing screens. This would have been a lot easier if we were doing it in person in a meeting.
