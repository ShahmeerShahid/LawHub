Communication Response Time: within 3 hours (on all platforms)

Standup Meetings: Online (Discord group call), and additionally once a week on Thursdays 3-5pm face to face.  Lazar will record meeting minutes.

Meeting Preparation:
Members will come to meetings with a personal list of questions and issues that have come up. They will then present these questions and issues and the group members will work together to overcome these obstacles. Members will also be prepared to show any code that the group agreed to demonstrate at the meeting.

Version Control:
Members will be branching for each user story and committing after completing a functioning module of the implementation or a bug fix. Members will be pushing at the end of every work session. Upon completion of a user story, members will be merging their branch with the master branch. Commit messages will be written in present tense and begin with a verb. Messages must be sufficiently descriptive to be an accurate representation of what changed in the commit.

Roles and Division of Work:
After estimating user stories and assigning priorities, we would work on dividing the user stories. Our group members have a variety of different skills and experience so we would firstly assign user stories to members with the related experience. As well, we would group related user stories and assign them to the same member. If there are remaining user stories, we will equally distribute them to the members.

Submitting Sprint Deliverables and Software
Submissions will be finalized 24 hours before sprint due dates, to ensure we have enough time to work out any issues. Lazar will be the member who submits the final deliverable. Team meetings will be held to review the submission of any key deliverables. 

Contingency Planning
If a group member drops out: Meet with Ilir as we will have less than 5 members and all other students in the course would be in groups. Meet as a group to review the code of the member that dropped out. All members of the team need to understand the work of the member that dropped out. We will also reassign all user stories that were assigned to the member that dropped out, either based on familiarity with the code (e.g. front-end/back-end), or equally.

If a team member misses a meeting: Missing team member will be expected to send a text-based summary of their work (what they would have talked about in the meeting) in the Messenger group chat. If a time doesn’t work for a team member the team will attempt to reschedule to a later time. If a team member misses more than 5 meetings we will alert Ilir to a possible disagreement.

If a team member does not submit on time (pre-emptive strategy): Organize user stories so that there are minimum prerequisites (i.e. minimize the number of user stories that depend on other user stories). If a team member requires help, then they can alert the team through the group chat; the group can work together to finish that user story.

If a team member commits an academic offence: if the work hasn’t been submitted yet, then remove the work and ask the team member to resubmit/cite their sources. If the work has already been submitted, then contact Ilir.
